# Med-ex-Chatbot
So I've divided the coding part into 3
where:
main.py is a backend part of the coding where all the responses from the bot I've created and trained.
long_responses.py is where when the user gives any input which is out of the context it replies to rephrase the question.
gui.py is the frontend of the coding where I created the chat box theme for the project.

To run the project please install python and all the required packages in your pc and double click on gui.py file to compile the code.
Thank you.
